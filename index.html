        <h1>During the School Year</h1>
        <p>
            PEAS provides direct outdoor and/or edible education to students and experiential professional development for teachers through year-long partnerships with schools in Austin. <br><br>

            Outdoor and/or edible education specialists work at a schools with the same students and teachers for an academic year. <br><br>

            Lessons utilize outdoor campus features such as gardens, wildflower meadows, and outdoor classrooms or teaching kitchens to engage kids in hands-on opportunities which cultivate and refine skills in science, math, social studies, language arts, health, and more.By participating in lessons, teachers continue to develop their outdoor leadership skills that bring academic content to life1 <br><br>

            Research shows that repeated exposure to nature and green spaces is more influential than one-time experiences in building appreciation and stewardship habits. A lack of repeat exposure is associated with the development of fear, discomfort, and dislike of the environment. Each student in the participating grades at each school experiences programming led by PEAS 12 to 14 times over the school year. <br><br>

Excellent way for students to learn about the environment in an outdoor setting. Students also benefit social emotionally from this experience and we see a positive impact in them."
